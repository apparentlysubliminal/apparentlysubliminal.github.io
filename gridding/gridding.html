							A refreshing rain reached the foothills today, as if the sky realized
							finally the stark reality of the humidity homework it had neglected,
							and at once overcompensated in a sudden slathering
							of drops and drips most unexpected.
							</p>
							<p>
							I contemplated my calamity and harrumphed and complained, when an
							elementary-aged boy sulked soaked into sight. His sagging backpack
							hanging just below his headful of defeat, he was dripping, the
							drumming drowning out the dragging soles of his feet.
							</p>
							<p>
							Wishing I could give him my umbrella or, at the least, tell him for
							all the squishing in his shoes, he was really some fella, I watched
							him from further down the block, patiently waiting while traffic
							splashed by until it was his turn to walk.
							</p>
							<p>			
							The clouds fled finally from the mountains, making for the beach, and
							the sun found enough small holes to make Wilson-y, "Hi-ho neighbor!"
							cameos, but nothing approached as affecting as an
							adolescent-administered attitude adjustment.
							</p>
							<p>			
							Would that I could do more than these words on this page,
							but as Doc Votaw would say, "weeee appreciate-cha, big guy,"
							for soggin' by my noggin today.
							</p>
							<p>			
							Everyone knows things get smaller the further they get away.
							</p>
							<p>			
							Provided you get the lines right, everything seems just as it should.
