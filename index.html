								A refreshing rain reached the foothills today, as if the sky realized
								finally the stark reality of the humidity homework it had neglected,
								and at once overcompensated in a sudden slathering
								of drops and drips most unexpected.
								<br><br>
								I contemplated my calamity and harrumphed and complained, when an
								elementary-aged boy sulked soaked into sight. His sagging backpack
								hanging just below his headful of defeat, he was dripping, the
								drumming drowning out the dragging soles of his feet.
								<br><br>
								Wishing I could give him my umbrella or, at the least, tell him for
								all the squishing in his shoes, he was really some fella, I watched
								him from further down the block, patiently waiting while traffic
								splashed by until it was his turn to walk.
								<br><br>
								The clouds fled finally from the mountains, making for the beach, and
								the sun found enough small holes to make Wilson-y, "Hi-ho neighbor!"
								cameos, but nothing approached as affecting as an
								adolescent-administered attitude adjustment.
								<br><br>
								Would that I could do more than these words on this page,
								but as Doc Votaw would say, "weeee appreciate-cha, big guy,"
								for soggin&rsquo; by my noggin today.
								<br><br>
								Everyone knows things get smaller the further they get away.
								<br><br>
								Provided you get the lines right, everything seems just as it should.

								I find myself frequently mashing clumsily on the screen of my phone with my thumbs. Often the use of both will stifle progress, as the left thumb forgets the right thumb is leading and bris&eacute;s when it should have pli&eacute;d. Get your shit together, thumbs, for I've many an important emoji to transmit and nary a moment to tarry your transit.
								<br><br>
								Allegedly, we are all communicating at a rate without precedent; even the old clumsy-thumbsies. With pluses and likes and customizable feeds we're attaining attention we so basically need. It's an especially perfect time for phrenologists to peruse the pates of their potential patients, while future physiognomists fail to find faces.
								<br><br>
								While we're wondering where the world went, we're wandering where the world was.
								<br><br>
								Chin up. There are others and bears and things afoot.
								<br><br>
								Travel safely and be well. Less-than three, DL.
